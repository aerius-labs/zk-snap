# ZkSnap: Verifiable on/off chain DAO voting with ballot privacy using storage proofs

## Introduction
Introducing **ZkSnap**: the innovative solution that revolutionizes the way DAO voting is conducted.

Traditional voting systems often expose participants to the bandwagon effect, surveillance, and coercion, compromising the integrity of the decision-making process. ZkSnap changes the game by employing zk proofs, which allow individuals to cast their votes securely and anonymously. Your voting preferences remain confidential, safeguarding your autonomy and protecting against any external influence.

But it doesn't stop at privacy alone. Our unique integration of storage proofs guarantees the transparency and accuracy of the voting power of individuals. By leveraging storage proofs, we are able to verify the integrity of the voting individual and the exact voting power that they hold.

## Features
- **Privacy**: Cast your votes securely and anonymously.
- **Confidentiality**: Your voting preferences remain hidden, ensuring protection against external influences.
- **Transparency**: With the integration of storage proofs, the voting power of individuals is transparent and accurate.
- **Integrity**: Verify the authenticity of the voting individual and their exact voting power.
